While Python has been the most popular programming language since 2019, data scientists often critique its slow speed and limited capabilities in handling big data scenarios. In this workshop series, we’ll tackle how to enhance Python’s performance in data science by diving deep into its workings and leveraging technologies to transform Python into an effective tool for high-performance big data analytics.

This folder contains the PDF slides and colab demos for the "Python for High Performance Data Analytics" workshop series hosted by UCLA OARC. 

The lecture contents are currently updated for May 2024.
